# College Clustering based on neighborhood
## Capstone project for IBM Data Science Specialization

## If the file is too big to view in github, you may use online jupyter notebook viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

I clustered over a couple thousand colleges and universities providing my course from USA, UK, and Australia offering "Computer Science Engineering" master's course. The clustering is based on location and the clusters show the type of 'vibes' of the neighborhood. It takes all public places available near that college within 10km radium and finds the type of places available near that college. Play with the values and find your own new results. Get new results relevant to your time.
